"Rear Differential - Final Drive - Various Ratios - Weir Performance - GT86 & BRZ, JZX90 & JZX100",440,,"Crown Wheel & Pinion Set for GT86 & BRZWeir final drive gears are CNC machined and lapped for quiet operation!The high quality ring and pinion gear set is shot peened, a process which further strengthens the gears and adds durability.  As a result, we are proud to offer enthusiasts the best final drive gears on the market today. What is a final drive gear set?The final drive ratio is the final gearing between your transmission and the driven wheels.  By changing it, you can affect the performance of your car. A lower number final drive ratio will lead to less torque at the wheels but a higher top speed. A higher number offers more torque at the wheels, closes the gear ratios, and a lower top speed. The standard ration for a GT86 & BRZ is 4. 1By changing your final gear ratios, you can optimise the car for different applications. eg: 1, GT86 but want more acceleration and closer gear ratios to keep the engine in the correct rev band - use a 4. 30, 4. 56 or 4. 88. eg: 2 GT86 automatic cars from the factory have very high gear ratios, 4th in the auto is the same ratio as 5th in the manual car.  Use a 4. 56 or 4. 88 to improve acceleration. eg: 3, Forest rallying requires close ratios and usually only a low top speed - use a 4. 88 or 5. 30. eg: 4, cars using a gearbox conversion where a lower ratio is required - use a 3. 58.

Will the Manufacturer be able to tell if my ecu has been reflashed?It is possible but unlikely, the Ecutek software has a flash count as does the standard software, however they can't see each other.  and factory diagnostic tool will still work with our Ecutek software. Can the fault codes still be read?Yes, both the Manufacturer and generic OBD readers suitable for GT86 and BRZ can still read fault codes (DTC's)What if there's a recall or a warranty claim pending?If required the ecu can be reflashed back to standard, once recall work is complete, the tuned map can be re installed. Do I need to purchase a license?An Ecutek license essentially unlocks the ecu and allows us to overwrite the standard rom file with our modified files.  A license is only required the first time you flash the car, after this you can reflash as many times as you like. I already have an Ecutek license?If your car already has an Ecutek license, you can still use our Fensport Maps. Is a Ecutek license transferable?No the Ecutek license is a one time purchase for each individual ecu. What about future updates?Software and main dealer map updates will be made available as they are released. Ecutek are continually developing the software with future modifications and upgrades in mind. Future remaps are chargeable, cost depends on modifications and time spent, we charge £75 + vat per hour for extra mapping work.

Crankshaft Main Bearing Set - King pMax Black - pMax Kote - All Sizes - GT86 & BRZ - FA20 - 4UGSE,91.11,,"King Main Bearing Set FA20 / 4U-GSEYou may notice a large price discrepancy across internet on king bearings for the FA20, this is mostly down to there being so different variants of these bearings.  Rest assured we only sell the very best version of this bearing which is the pMax Black and pMax Kote coated version.  The option we would choose every single time when building a high performance engine.  If you have found these bearings cheaper they are likely NOT the pMax Kote version. pMax Black is a unique tri-metal structure for race applications.  The overlay is strengthened by a proprietary nano-scaled hardening process that modifies the molecular structure and creates a black fatigue-resistant shield. pMax Kote  is a revolutionary new approach to coated bearings.  This unique polymer coating is applied over Kings pMaxBlack overlay at the King factory during the bearing manufacturing process.  Kings pMaxKote contains ceramic nano-composite particles that function as a fourth layer to enhance wear resistance.  pMaxKote does not change the bearings original precision wall thickness and adds no additional thickness.  It provides additional seizure resistance, superior cavitation resistance, improved wear resistance and protection against oil starvation. The FA20 race bearings are designed with all of Kings racing line features including the pMax Black unique tri-metal structure, allowing 24% greater load capacity than any other race bearing available. By incorporating exclusive King features like Elliptix oil ingress and 360 degree oil grooves, oil starvation is all but eliminated.  Plus, Kings SmartLug main bearing design shuts the leakage path and resolves one of the weakest links in a high output FA engines. The result is a more reliable FA engine that can support higher loads produced in race winning, championship engines.

Water Injection Kit - ERL System - HFS-V3.1,571.87,,"ERL Water Injection Kit System HFS-V3. 1Failsafe Water/Meth injection :) For years people have used water injection, however there has always been that worry that what if it fails? Should you map for it? Now we have the HFSV3-3 kit from Aquamist and have developed failsafe mapping for Ecutek with custom RaceRom maps and also Link & Motec Ecu's.  The system is so good and instantly reacts, we can hold the car on full throttle and literally switch the WI on and off, the maps change instantly allowing us to turn WI in to the ""Power Adder"" it should be! :)The Aquamist system has a 0-5v output based on water flow, which we can use to switch maps when linked to a programmable ecu, allowing the correct calibration of fuel & ignition as well as map switching and boost or throttle reduction if required :)Aquamist has been pioneering the IDC based water injection system since 2003 with great success.  The HFS3-pwm system is designed to complete the Aquamists PWM-valve delivery system line-up, it allows precise metering of water/methanol injection for the modern high performance engine.  The dash gauge, flow sensor and Plug and Play features are standard to minimise installation time. The system retrieves the fuel flow (IDC) and manifold pressure signals (MPS) from the engine management system as the prime source to control the flow of water.  This enables perfect balance of water to fuel flow under all engine loads.  The system can also be controlled by a third-party ECU with its own custom water/methanol flow map. A Fast Acting Valve (FAV) controls the delivery rate based on the PWM signal from the HFS-3 controller.  A constant line pressure (160 psi) is provided by the Aquatec pump working in the by-pass mode.  A PWM valve system guarantees wide dynamic range. The HFS-V3. 1 kit comes with a pre wired harness to simplify installation.  ",Water tank not included.,Not In Stock,FenSport
Cam Blanking Plate - Racer X - Black - GT86 & BRZ,61,,"GT86 - Cylinder Head Cam Blanking Plate - Black The Racer X Fabrication cam blanking plate is a great way to stop that pesky oil leak and requires no messy sealant!Installation can be performed from the engine bay.  The quattro o-ring seals on all sides instead of just two, this ensures that you will not run into any future issues with the cylinder head plate. Construction:Many GT86 & BRZ's start leaking oil onto the exhaust.  The standard stamped steel plate is very flimsy so Racer X started with a 3/8"" thick piece of flat stock 6061-T6 aluminum.  We then face mill both sides for flatness, and machine an o-ring groove into the plate.  We use a viton o-ring that is oil resistant and rated for high temperatures.  We also use a quattro cross section instead of the standard circular cross section for the o-ring.  Finally we machine out an island and add our logo, the island acts as a stiffening rib to prevent deflection during installation and reduces weight of the overall part.

Fensport - NA Remap - GT86 & BRZ,299,,"Toyota GT86 & Subaru BRZ - Normally Aspirated Remap Note: Available with or without Ecutek License. An Ecutek License is a one time seperate charge and is required if the vehicle has not been mapped via Ecutek before. At Fensport we have been extremely busy working on ECU remapping using the brilliant Ecutek software to reflash the standard ecu.  To date we have tested many different configurations of maps as well as countless miles of road, dyno, track and race testing to bring you our Fensport NA ecu remap service. Our very own GT86 has been modified with a Blitz panel filter, Samco intake hose, 2nd cat removed and a free flow exhaust, alloy pulleys and a lightened flywheel has shown an impressive peak power of 218. 4bhp an increase of 25bhp at 7054rpm and almost 20lb/ft torque increase.  Nice figures for a lightly modified normally aspirated engine!We also incorporate the excellent Racerom features which include the ability to switch between 4 maps on the move via cruise control stalk.  Also includes Launch Control, Full Throttle Gearchange, Auto Blip on downshift, In gear rpm limits. Our NA remap includes 4 maps. Map 1: Full Performance map, for use with 97+ ron fuel, ie: Super Unleaded.  7,650rpm rev limit.  This map is also configured for economy on cruise. Map 2: Full Performance and adds Launch Control and Full throttle gear change.  7,650rpm rev limit. Map 3: Full Performance and adds Launch Control and Full throttle gear change and Auto Blip on down shift.  7,650rpm rev limit. Map 4: 95 Ron map, can be used with normal unleaded fuel when super unleaded is unavailable.  Rpm limit is reduced to standard 7,400rpm.  Note: this map produces lower power than map 1,2 or 3 and economy is reduced slightlyOur 4 maps are examples, you may choose your own sequence, rev limits, throttle response, racerom features etc. Options:Cold start retard removalMaps can be any sequenceRev limits in gear can be applied to any mapSoft cut rev limiterOil over and under temp warnings - engine checklightThrottle response can be tailored to individual customerVVT active - engine checklight warningOil Temperature - engine checklight warningNote: All of our maps are based on the latest Version software. More Information:Map Switching is carried out using the cruise control stalk, simply pull the stalk towards you for 1 second, rev counter will show 1k rpm, then simply move the cruise control stalk up or down to select your map, rev counter will show which map you have selected, then pull cruise control to lock that map.  All maps can be accessed on the move.  Launch Control is adjustable via cruise control stalk, with the car stopped and clutch down, go to full throttle and rpm is held at a pre set 4,500rpm.  Simply use cruise control stalk to increase or decrease in 250rpm increments. Full Throttle shift uses a rev limiter to cut the ignition timing so the driver need not lift off the throttle, just simply de clutch and pull the next gear. Auto Blip can be used to match the revs on downshift, the driver brakes and selects the lower gear and the electronic throttle automaticaly blips the throttle. Note: Competition cars without cruise control stalk can still switch maps using other switch configurations. Frequently asked questions:Can I return my car to standard map?Yes the standard map can always be re flashed. Will the Manufacturer be able to tell if my ecu has been reflashed?It is possible but unlikely, the Ecutek software has a flash count as does the standard software, however they can't see each other.  and factory diagnostic tool will still work with our Ecutek software. Can the fault codes still be read?Yes, both the Manufacturer and generic OBD readers suitable for GT86 and BRZ can still read fault codes (DTC's)What if there's a recall or a warranty claim pending?If required the ecu can be reflashed back to standard, once recall work is complete, the tuned map can be re installed. Do I need to purchase a license?An Ecutek license essentially unlocks the ecu and allows us to overwrite the standard rom file with our modified files.  A license is only required the first time you flash the car, after this you can reflash as many times as you like. I already have an Ecutek license?If your car already has an Ecutek license, you can still use our Fensport Maps.  If your Pro Ecu kit is registered to another tuner you will need to contact Ecutek and request a transfer to us. Is an Ecutek license transferrable?No the Ecutek license is a one time purchase for each individual ecu. What about future updates?Software and main dealer map updates will be made available as they are released. Ecutek are continually developing the software with future modifications and upgrades in mind. Future remaps are chargeable, cost depends on modifications and time spent, we charge £75 + vat per hour for extra mapping work. Do you use a generic map?We start with one of our many base maps and then map / tune the car to suit you and your vehicle.  Each vehicle and customer is different and we pride ourselves in getting the best from your car in a safe manner and we will taylor any of the available options to suit you. Do you use a rolling road?No all of our cars are road mapped, we do use rolling roads in the development of our rom files, these base roms are then fine tuned on your car in their natural environment the road. What is ""E Mapping"" or ""Remote Tuning""?You can still benefit from our Fensport Maps even if you don't live in the UK or you can't get your car to us.

To be able to guarantee the perfect suspension setup we test on our KW 7-post rig, as well as extensive driving tests on country roads, motorways and even on the Nürburgring Nordschleife.  For years, the KW coilover kit Variant 3 inox-line is one of the top aftermarket products and is a benchmark for coilovers.  It convinces sports car drivers, tuner, large-and small series manufacturer such as Alpina, MTM, Manthey, Oettinger and many more leading companies in the international automotive industry with its damping characteristics, quality finish and durability. Advanced technology from motor sportWith the KW coilovers Variant 3 inox-line you will get much more than just a sporty lowering and excellent driving behaviour on all roads.  It is based on our long experience as a suspension manufacturer and supplier for international motor sport, such as the touring car series ADAC GT Masters, FIA GT1, FIA GT3, International GT Open, WTC, VLN and the legendary ADAC Zurich 24h-race Nürburgring. Similar to our racing coilovers from the KW Competition program, the KW coilovers Variant 3 inox-line can be adjusted independently in compression and rebound damping.  This individual adjustment possibility is much appreciated by sports car manufacturers, tuners and drivers worldwide. The perfect suspension setup for more driving pleasureIf you have already made your first performance modifications to your vehicle our KW coilovers Variant 3 will compliment your upgrades.  The patented KW-valve technology for separate adjustment of rebound and compression damping allows you to individually setup your suspension. The adjustable KW bottom valve adjusts the low-speed range of the compression level in twelve clicks. You don't need any adjusting tools because of the patented compression adjuster at the lower end of the stainless steel housing.  The adjustable compression damping with its twelve exact clicks allows you to manually influence body roll, without having to change the spring rate which optimally matches the rebound. With the individually adjustable rebound setup of the KW coilover Variant 3 inox-line , you can directly influence the handling and comfort with its precise click adjustment.  Depending on the vehicle type, the rebound valves of the KW twin-tube dampers on the upper end of the piston rod will be adjusted via an integrated adjustment wheel or a twist-adjustment wheel which is included in the delivery content. By increasing the rebound force via the adjustment wheel body movements are reduced.  You will have more stability during high speed cornering.  If you change for example the wheel / tire combination (approved by the car manufacturer) to larger wheels, then with a KW coilover Variant 3 inox-line you will be able to adjust the car's handling perfectly. Print product descriptionHigh quality, individual and durableThe KW coilover Variant 3 inox-line kit and every single damper are subject to extensive quality tests during production to meet the high standards of our KW quality management.

By changing your final gear ratios, you can experience a dramatic increase in acceleration, giving you on average, a 10-15% increase in torque throughout the entire rev-range over the OEM Final Drive. What is a final drive gear set?The final drive ratio is the final gearing between your transmission and the driven wheels.  By changing it, you can affect the performance of your car. A lower number final drive ratio will lead to less torque at the wheels but a higher top speed. A higher number offers more torque at the wheels, closes the gear ratios, and a lower top speed. The standard ration for a GT86 & BRZ is 4. 1By changing your final gear ratios, you can optimise the car for different applications. eg: 1, GT86 but want more acceleration and closer gear ratios to keep the engine in the correct rev band - use a 4. 44 or 4. 67. eg: 2, GT86 automatic cars from the factory have very high gear ratios, 4th in the auto is the same ratio as 5th in the manual car.  We recommend 4. 67 to improve acceleration. Note: You will also need to replace the following parts when installing the final drive.  These can be found in the Drivetrain section.

Built using pre-preg.  carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite materials for superior strength-to-weight ratio, APR Air Ducts add both function and ""lightness"" where it counts.  The APR Brake Cooling Ducts are aerodynamically-optimized to ""funnel in"" massive amounts of air.  Also known as the venturi effect, when the vehicle speed increases, this funnelled-in air increases in both pressure and velocity as it passes from the larger frontal area into the smaller pipe section of the brake duct.  When matched with appropriate high-temperature air duct hoses (not included - purchase hoses from your favourite racing-supply shop), the APR Brake Cooling Ducts will help to channel in large volumes of fresh air to help cool down red-hot brake rotors lap after lap on the track.  Features:Factory-like fitmentThis vehicle-specific component is designed to match the contours of the vehicle's body, for a factory-like fitment. Carbon Fibre ConstructionThis component is formed in the autoclave at high temperatures using pre-pregnated carbon fibre manufacturing processes, for high strength and low weight. UV Resistant CoatingEach Air Duct is finished with UV-resistant clear-coat paint for resistance against various environmental conditions (take care of this as you would take care of your vehicle's paint finish - polish then coat with good-quality wax or synthetic protectant). Mounting Hardware IncludedScrews, nuts and bolts are all included to allow you to install the APR Air Ducts to your vehicle. ",No notes available,Not In Stock,FenSport

Fensport - Supercharger Remap - GT86 & BRZ,380,,"Fensport GT86 / BRZ - Forced Induction Remap for Supercharger applicationsNote: Available with or without Ecutek License.  An Ecutek License is a one time seperate charge and is required if the vehicle has not been mapped via Ecutek before. At Fensport we have been extremely busy working on ECU remapping using the brilliant Ecutek software to reflash the standard ecu.  To date we have tested many different configurations of maps as well as countless miles of road, dyno, track and race testing to bring you our Supercharger ecu remap service. Currently we have rom files for the following superchargersCosworth, HKS, Kraftwerks, Harrop, Litchfield, Vortec We also incorporate the excellent Racerom features which can include Fensport RaceRom Forced Induction features:4 maps - switchableLaunch Control - Manual transmissionFull Throttle Gear change - Manual transmissionAuto Blip on downshift - Manual transmissionIn gear rpm limitsRaised Load limitsVVT active - engine checklight warningOil Temperature - engine checklight warningNote 1: Cars with larger maf tubes, blow through mafs, larger airboxes, larger fuel injectors and Speed density will all require extra mapping, which is charged at £75 per hour. Note 2: Remote mapping can be done but we require the customer to install a wideband afr guage / meter.  Please contact us for further details. Note 3: We advise using 98 Ron fuel with all forced induction setups. Note 4: Competition cars without cruise control stalk can still switch maps using other switch configurations. Frequently asked questions:Can I return my car to standard map?Yes the standard map can always be re flashed. Will the Manufacturer be able to tell if my ecu has been reflashed?It is possible but unlikely, the Ecutek software has a flash count as does the standard software, however they can't see each other.  and factory diagnostic tool will still work with our Ecutek software. Can the fault codes still be read?Yes, both the Manufacturer and generic OBD readers suitable for GT86 and BRZ can still read fault codes (DTC's)What if there's a recall or a warranty claim pending?If required the ecu can be reflashed back to standard, once recall work is complete, the tuned map can be re installed. Do I need to purchase a license?A Ecutek license essentially unlocks the ecu and allows us to overwrite the standard rom file with our modified files.  A license is only required the first time you flash the car, after this you can reflash as many times as you like.  I already have an Ecutek license?If your car already has an Ecutek license, you can still use our Fensport Maps. Is a Ecutek license transferrable?No the Ecutek license is a one time purchase for each individual ecu. What about future updates?Software and main dealer map updates will be made available as they are released, we charge £75 + vat per hour for extra mapping work. Ecutek are continually developing the software with future modifications and upgrades in mind. Future remaps are chargeable, cost depends on modifications and time spent. Do you use a generic map?We start with one of our many base maps and then map / tune the car to suit you and your vehicle.  Each vehicle and customer is different and we pride ourselves in getting the best from your car in a safe manner and we will tailor any of the available options to suit you and your modifications. Do you use a rolling road?No all of our cars are road mapped, we do use rolling roads in the development of our rom files, these base roms are then fine tuned on your car in their natural environment the road.  What is ""E Mapping"" or ""Remote Tuning""?You can still use our Fensport Maps even if you don't live in the UK or you can't get your car to us.  You need to purchase or hire the ""ProECU Programming Kit"" and purchase a ""License/ Map Calibration"" which will allow you to programme our Fensport Maps in to your vehicle.  maps will be sent to you via email, you will upload to your vehicle, go for a drive and capture log files to email back to us for diagnosis and modification.  Note: All forced induction setups require an external wideband afr guage or input.  The factory sensor is not always reliable with forced induction. What is EcuTek EVi Connect - with Programming?The ""Programming Kit"" allows you to programme our Fensport Maps to your vehicle. The EVi Connect also includes the ability to read and clear fault codes (DTC's) as well as log ecu parameters, capture log files to email back to us for diagnosis and modification.  You will also be able to return the car back to standard if necessary.  The programming kit does not allow you to change the calibration of our Fensport maps.

Turbo Blanket Jacket - Funk Motorsport - T25 - Titanium Weave,112.5,,"Funk Motorsport Turbo Blanket JacketTo Suit T25 TurbochargersTitanium Weave After intensive development and testing, the Mk3 T25 Turbo Blanket has arrived.  Funk Motorsport Turbo Blankets provide huge heat reductions to provide a higher performing engine and a more reliable system.  With the success of their initial Turbo Blanket at the heart of the design, they have taken the best parts of the original blanket along with some exciting upgrades to provide the strongest and most reliable T25 Turbo Jacket to date.  All of the Funk turbo blankets now feature:Internal mesh layer reinforcement throughout. Smart mesh on all internal seams and key external seams to ensure longevity. Uprated twill on both our Titanium and Carbon fibre options providing a more durable, great looking finish. Funk Motorsport Black label to provide authenticity of your Funk Motorsport product. Since a Turbo utilises the hot gas flow of the exhaust and the cool air flow of the intake, the close positioning of these two halves of the turbo leads to a high amount of heat soak.  This blend of hot and cold parts of the turbo creates issues for both performance and reliability.  This T25 Turbo Blanket will sit comfortably over the hot side (turbine housing) to ensure that the cold side (compressor housing) is working at optimal temperatures.  A cooler intake temperature results in the MAF sensor reading a denser air and therefore allows for an increased ignition spark.  This leads to a higher output of rotational energy from inside the combustion chamber.  More Energy = More Power!Also, by keeping the hot air inside the turbo, this will actually accelerate the gases out of the system and so providing a faster spool time, helping to reduce Turbo Lag. Available in both Titanium Lava Rock and lightweight Carbon Fibre. Metal retaining spring are also included for quick, easy fitment.

Fensport - Turbo Remap - GT86 & BRZ,425,,"Fensport GT86 / BRZ - Turbo Remap with electronic boost control. Note: Available with or without Ecutek License.  An Ecutek License is a one time seperate charge and is required if the vehicle has not been mapped via Ecutek before. At Fensport we have been extremely busy working on ECU remapping using the brilliant Ecutek software to reflash the standard ecu.  To date we have tested many different configurations of maps and turbo configurations, as well as countless miles of road, dyno, track and race testing to bring you our Fensport Turbo ecu remap service. Turbo Remap is suitable for a wide range of turbo kits running with standard fuel injectors and ""suck through"" mafs / airboxes. RaceRom Forced Induction features: 4 maps - switchable Launch Control - Manual transmission Full Throttle Gear change - Manual transmission Auto Blip on downshift - Manual transmission In gear rpm limits Raised Load limits VVT active - engine checklight warning Oil Temperature - engine checklight warningTurbo specific features: Electronic closed loop boost control - Turbo applications (valve and wiring required) Up to 4 different boost settings via map switching Oil, Water & Air Temperature, vvt & advance multiplier dependant boost control for safety Throttle and gear dependant boost control Over boost protectionNote 1: Our Turbo Remap does not include cars with larger maf tubes, blow through mafs, larger airboxes, larger fuel injectors, speed density etc will require our Turbo Remap AdvancedNote 2: Remote mapping can be done but we require the customer to install a wideband afr guage / meter.  Please contact us for further details. Note 3: We advise using 98 Ron fuel with all forced induction setups. Note 4: Competition cars without cruise control stalk can still switch maps using other switch configurations. Note 5: Boost control valve required. Frequently asked questions:Can I return my car to standard map?Yes the standard map can always be re flashed. Will the Manufacturer be able to tell if my ecu has been reflashed?It is possible but unlikely, the Ecutek software has a flash count as does the standard software, however they can't see each other.  and factory diagnostic tool will still work with our Ecutek software. Can the fault codes still be read?Yes, both the Manufacturer and generic OBD readers suitable for GT86 and BRZ can still read fault codes (DTC's)What if there's a recall or a warranty claim pending?If required the ecu can be reflashed back to standard, once recall work is complete, the tuned map can be re installed. Do I need to purchase a license?An Ecutek license essentially unlocks the ecu and allows us to overwrite the standard rom file with our modified files.  A license is only required the first time you flash the car, after this you can reflash as many times as you like. I already have an Ecutek license?If your car already has an Ecutek license, you can still use our Fensport Maps. Is a Ecutek license transferable?No the Ecutek license is a one time purchase for each individual ecu. What about future updates?Software and main dealer map updates will be made available as they are released. Ecutek are continually developing the software with future modifications and upgrades in mind. Future remaps are chargeable, cost depends on modifications and time spent, we charge £75 + vat per hour for extra mapping work. Do you use a generic map?We start with one of our many base maps and then map / tune the car to suit you and your vehicle.  Each vehicle and customer is different and we pride ourselves in getting the best from your car in a safe manner and we will tailor any of the available options to suit you and your modifications. Do you use a rolling road?No all of our cars are road mapped, we do use rolling roads in the development of our rom files, these base roms are then fine tuned on your car in their natural environment the road. What is ""E Mapping"" or ""Remote Tuning""?You can still use our Fensport Maps even if you don't live in the UK or you can't get your car to us.  You need to purchase or hire the ""ProECU Programming Kit"" and purchase a ""License/ Map Calibration"" which will allow you to programme our Fensport Maps in to your vehicle.  maps will be sent to you via email, you will upload to your vehicle, go for a drive and capture log files to email back to us for diagnosis and modification.  Note: All forced induction setups require an external wideband afr guage or input.  The factory sensor is not always reliable with forced induction. What is EcuTek EVi Connect - with Programming?The ""Programming Kit"" allows you to programme our Fensport Maps to your vehicle. The EVi Connect also includes the ability to read and clear fault codes (DTC's) as well as log ecu parameters, capture log files to email back to us for diagnosis and modification.  You will also be able to return the car back to standard if necessary.  The programming kit does not allow you to change the calibration of our Fensport maps.  However we can supply a standard ""open"" map if you wish to self tune. Please call for further information or to book your remap. ",No notes available,Not In Stock,FenSport

The BRZ/FRS engine has both port and direct Injectors fitted, testing has shown the standard fuel delivery capacity is around 300bhp. Larger Port Injectors will be required for any forced induction vehicle running over 300bhp on regular petrol, they will also be required on any forced induction vehicle running on Ethanol (like E85) regardless of the power output (where 30%+ more fuel volume is required compared to regular petrol). We have extensively tested these Bosch Motorsport injectors on our own in-house forced induction GT86 and we developed accurate injector calibration settings that are supplied with each kit. The larger port injectors will supply enough fuel for 500+ bhp on regular petrol. These injectors are a perfect fit, with the injection nozzle protruding into the inlet manifold in exactly the same position as the standard injectors.  Other aftermarket injectors either impede airflow by protruding too far into the intake, or spray fuel onto the inlet manifold walls, resulting in poor fuel droplet atomisation. Due to their position and design, these injectors produce significantly better fuel atomisation than any other currently available high flow injector, providing you with better fuel consumption, more efficient combustion, and excellent distribution at low opening times, this eliminates the usual problems at idle and slow running conditions.

Once the engine is fully warmed up, the Mishimoto racing thermostat will open at a lower temperature than standard thermostats.  This allows coolant to flow through the engine sooner, which reduces and maintains cooler engine temperatures.  The Mishimoto GT86 racing thermostat is the perfect addition to your street or track Toyota and is a direct replacement for the factory thermostat.  As with all Mishimoto products, this thermostat includes a lifetime warranty. Fensport Tip: When mapping your car with EcuTek or similar ask your tuner to reduce the operating temperature of the radiator fans and you will be running cooler when in traffic or at the start line.  On a standard car both fans are 100% active at 103 degrees, our GT86R Race car reduces this to 83 degrees, some 20 degrees cooler when it leaves the start line.

Turbo Blanket Jacket - Funk Motorsport - T25 - Carbon Weave,116.67,,"Funk Motorsport Turbo Blanket JacketTo Suit T25 TurbochargersCarbon Weave After intensive development and testing, the Mk3 T25 Turbo Blanket has arrived.  Funk Motorsport Turbo Blankets provide huge heat reductions to provide a higher performing engine and a more reliable system.  With the success of their initial Turbo Blanket at the heart of the design, they have taken the best parts of the original blanket along with some exciting upgrades to provide the strongest and most reliable T25 Turbo Jacket to date.  All of the Funk turbo blankets now feature:Internal mesh layer reinforcement throughout. Smart mesh on all internal seams and key external seams to ensure longevity. Uprated twill on both our Titanium and Carbon fibre options providing a more durable, great looking finish. Funk Motorsport Black label to provide authenticity of your Funk Motorsport product. Since a Turbo utilises the hot gas flow of the exhaust and the cool air flow of the intake, the close positioning of these two halves of the turbo leads to a high amount of heat soak.  This blend of hot and cold parts of the turbo creates issues for both performance and reliability.  This T25 Turbo Blanket will sit comfortably over the hot side (turbine housing) to ensure that the cold side (compressor housing) is working at optimal temperatures.  A cooler intake temperature results in the MAF sensor reading a denser air and therefore allows for an increased ignition spark.  This leads to a higher output of rotational energy from inside the combustion chamber.  More Energy = More Power!Also, by keeping the hot air inside the turbo, this will actually accelerate the gases out of the system and so providing a faster spool time, helping to reduce Turbo Lag. Available in both Titanium Lava Rock and lightweight Carbon Fibre. Metal retaining spring are also included for quick, easy fitment.
