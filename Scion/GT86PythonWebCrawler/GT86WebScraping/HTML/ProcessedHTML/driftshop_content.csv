Sytec Motorsport 255 L/h Fuel Pump Kit - Toyota GT86 & Subaru BRZ,104.99,,"Sytec 255 LPH Fuel Pump Kit – Toyota GT86 & Subaru BRZ
When tuning an engine, the original fuel pump is often unsuitable and no longer able to provide enough fuel. The consequences can be disastrous, with the worst case being engine failure from running lean.
Sytec fuel pump kits are the first step towards increasing fuel system function and reliability. Note that by itself, a high flow fuel pump does not increase the power of your vehicle. They are used to replace a tired OE pump or when there’s a need for increased fuel flow, such as applications with increased boost pressure, larger injectors, or other changes. These pumps are capable of providing enough fuel for over 400HP.

Tein EDFC Active Pro Kit ,695.99,,"Tein EDFC Active Pro Specifications
With the Tein EDFC Active (Electronic Damping Force Controller) system, you no longer have to get out of your vehicle, open the hood or remove the rear linings to adjust the hardness of your suspension! You can now adjust it from inside the car, via a control unit operating the motors placed on the adjustment knobs of your Tein shock absorbers.
In addition, the system allows you to take advantage of an adjustment range extended to 64 settings (instead of 32 with the EDFC 2 and 16 without) for superior control. You can also keep 3 hardness settings memorized that you then activate with a finger depending on the situation: city, highway, winding roads ...
Unlike the EDFC Active which allows you to adjust the damping hardness independently between the front and the rear but simultaneously between the left and the right, the EDFC Active Pro allows the individual adjustment of the 4 dampers. In addition, while the EDFC Active offers an automatic firmness control according to the variations of g force at acceleration and deceleration (longitudinal force), this evolution adds an automatic adjustment capacity according to the changes of g forces in turns (lateral force). This gives you the ability to limit chassis roll, control the load distribution left / right when cornering and increase your speed when cornering. The EDFC Active Pro also includes an automatic speed-dependent adjustment (note that signal acquisition may not be possible on certain vehicles). The longitudinal g force, lateral g force and speed modes can be combined for an unprecedented precise adjustment.
The system has two additional external input ports to suit all needs. For example, it is possible to connect it to the handbrake signal for better management of drifts, to a universal switch that the driver can operate depending on the situation, etc.
For simplified installation and wiring, the EDFC Active Pro has wireless control. The control unit is connected wirelessly to the motor control unit, avoiding the installation of complicated and unsightly wiring.
The Tein EDFC Active Pro system control unit has an extended display with a 22 x 60 mm screen for better visibility and incorporates a tri-axial acceleration sensor for perfect functioning regardless of its layout in the vehicle.
The product offers many other functions: choice of the frequency for resetting the motors to zero, choice of the minimum speed before activation of the adjustment according to g force, automatic adjustment of the intensity of the display, adjustable display angle on two positions, volume adjustment, self-diagnosis and alert, screen color adjustment, display of the damping hardness level, g force and speed, or even locking controls.
With additional equipment, it is possible to manage Tein coilovers with separate adjustment of compression and rebound (Super Racing for example). The EDFC Active control unit is capable of controlling up to 8 motors independently using additional control units.  Contact us for more information on the necessary parts.
The Tein EDFC Active system is compatible with the Tein EnduraPro Plus, EnduraPro Plus SP Kit, Street Flex, Street Advance Z, Street Advance Z4, Mono Racing, Mono Sport, Flex A, Flex Z suspensions. To ensure compatibility '' EDFC with your vehicle and your coilovers, don't hesitate to use the Tein Europe official search engine. The latter also allows you to confirm the type of motors required depending on the model.
Optional equipment :

Strut Kit : recommended for vehicles with front struts, the Strut Kit avoids the risk of the EDFC wiring getting tangled by adding a stopper bracket
GPS Kit : available for EDFC Active and Active Pro, the GPS Kit adds additional functionalities to the system. Among these, the possibility of automatically modulating the hardness of the damping according to the speed of the vehicle, or of simultaneously using the adjustment modes relating to the speed and to the g force.

EDFC Motors Kit M14-14 (Ref. EDK05-14140) ,168.99,,"Tein EDFC Active Pro Specifications
With the Tein EDFC Active (Electronic Damping Force Controller) system, you no longer have to get out of your vehicle, open the hood or remove the rear linings to adjust the hardness of your suspension! You can now adjust it from inside the car, via a control unit operating the motors placed on the adjustment knobs of your Tein shock absorbers.
In addition, the system allows you to take advantage of an adjustment range extended to 64 settings (instead of 32 with the EDFC 2 and 16 without) for superior control. You can also keep 3 hardness settings memorized that you then activate with a finger depending on the situation: city, highway, winding roads ...
Unlike the EDFC Active which allows you to adjust the damping hardness independently between the front and the rear but simultaneously between the left and the right, the EDFC Active Pro allows the individual adjustment of the 4 dampers. In addition, while the EDFC Active offers an automatic firmness control according to the variations of g force at acceleration and deceleration (longitudinal force), this evolution adds an automatic adjustment capacity according to the changes of g forces in turns (lateral force). This gives you the ability to limit chassis roll, control the load distribution left / right when cornering and increase your speed when cornering. The EDFC Active Pro also includes an automatic speed-dependent adjustment (note that signal acquisition may not be possible on certain vehicles). The longitudinal g force, lateral g force and speed modes can be combined for an unprecedented precise adjustment.
The system has two additional external input ports to suit all needs. For example, it is possible to connect it to the handbrake signal for better management of drifts, to a universal switch that the driver can operate depending on the situation, etc.
For simplified installation and wiring, the EDFC Active Pro has wireless control. The control unit is connected wirelessly to the motor control unit, avoiding the installation of complicated and unsightly wiring.
The Tein EDFC Active Pro system control unit has an extended display with a 22 x 60 mm screen for better visibility and incorporates a tri-axial acceleration sensor for perfect functioning regardless of its layout in the vehicle.
The product offers many other functions: choice of the frequency for resetting the motors to zero, choice of the minimum speed before activation of the adjustment according to g force, automatic adjustment of the intensity of the display, adjustable display angle on two positions, volume adjustment, self-diagnosis and alert, screen color adjustment, display of the damping hardness level, g force and speed, or even locking controls.
With additional equipment, it is possible to manage Tein coilovers with separate adjustment of compression and rebound (Super Racing for example). The EDFC Active control unit is capable of controlling up to 8 motors independently using additional control units.  Contact us for more information on the necessary parts.
The Tein EDFC Active system is compatible with the Tein EnduraPro Plus, EnduraPro Plus SP Kit, Street Flex, Street Advance Z, Street Advance Z4, Mono Racing, Mono Sport, Flex A, Flex Z suspensions. To ensure compatibility '' EDFC with your vehicle and your coilovers, don't hesitate to use the Tein Europe official search engine. The latter also allows you to confirm the type of motors required depending on the model.
Optional equipment :

Strut Kit : recommended for vehicles with front struts, the Strut Kit avoids the risk of the EDFC wiring getting tangled by adding a stopper bracket

The ARP 2000 is frequently recommended for engines used in intense disciplines such as circuit racing or drag racing.L19 : made from ""premium"" steel which has received numerous treatments, offering a more substantial resistance compared to the ARP 2000 (260.000 psi tensile strength).The L19 is recommended for high powered engines used in intense disciplines such as circuit racing or drag racing. However, unlike the ARP 2000 and 8740, the material which the L19 is made from is not rust proof and requires certain precautions for use.Custom Age : new alloy designed by ARP, this material has outstanding resistant properties (up to 280.000 psi of tensile strength). Completely rust proof, it is exclusive to ARP and is the best solution existing on the market.For more technical information, don't hesitate to check out the ARP official site.","Toyota ARP Rod BoltsARP Rod BoltsTo suit : Toyota 4U-GSEMaterial, version : Pro Series ARP 2000Ideal for a repair / rebuild or an upgradeSuperior quality and resistance to OEM partsARP reference : 203-6302",Not In Stock,DriftShop

Press Release
Cobra Sport have worked hard to secure a first class reputation amongst GT86 owners and tuners both in the UK and worldwide. Building upon this success, Cobra Sport are pleased to announce the launch of their latest development for the GT86, consisting of a 4-1 de-cat manifold.
The de-cat manifold has been designed with unequal length sections with optimised lightweight pipe lengths and angles. This precision engineering improves gas flow efficiency by removing the catalyst at the most important part of the system for overall performance improvements. This improvements in flow dramatically reduces the effects of torque dip experienced by many GT86 owners and is optimised for further power increases through engine tuning. During testing, the GT86 passed the MOT emissions test with the Cobra Sport manifold fitted as long as either the standard cat or Cobra Sport high flow catalyst is in place.
The Cobra Sport GT86 manifold produces a deeper more aggressive exhaust tone. The acoustics of the de-cat manifold have been finely tuned to complement the tone of the extended Cobra Sport range for the GT86 offering the ultimate upgrade in terms of possible power increase and pitch perfect exhaust tone.

Working closely with one of the UK's major tuning houses, Cobra Sport have developed a performance system for the iconic GT86/BRZ.
Cobra Sport bring over 40 years of experience to the design and engineering of quality, performance orientated exhaust systems.
Matt Thomas, Cobra Sport's Sales Manager explains the improvements achieved. ""Independent testing shows that the primary cat-back system boosts performance from an initial 196.5bhp to a genuine 207.5bhp when working in conjunction with a AEM forced air induction filter. The bore size is increased by 18% to 63.5mm and the system benefits from a 27% reduction in weight when compared to the OE system.""

Kaaz Limited Slip Differentials SpecificationsKaaz clutch type LSDs are made in Japan. They are extremely efficient, reliable and great value for money. Whether for drifting, sporty driving on road or track, or for pure racing, they are acclaimed around the world by both amateur and professional drivers.Equipped with 8 to 24 discs depending on the model, Kaaz differentials guarantee constant, reliable locking, as well as rapid, efficient and predictive behavior for maximum traction and perfect control. Kaaz limited slip differentials come with all required accessories for installation : they replace the internals of the stock differential by re-using the crown gear and the drive pinion, and go in place without any modification. By favouring traction and control, a Kaaz limited slip differential radically transforms and improves the handling and safety of your vehicle.1.5-Way or 2-Way ?Kaaz LSDs are generally available in 1.5-way and 2-way versions. The fundamental difference between a Kaaz 1.5-way and 2-way LSD is its reaction during deceleration : thanks to a particular design of the cams acting on the differential lock, a 1.5-way LSD will react only very slightly when lifting off the accelerator. This feature makes 1.5-way LSDs more suitable for use on an open road, or for use in sporty driving, such as ""grip"".Meanwhile, a 2-way Kaaz self-locking differential will block as much when accelerating as when lifting the foot. This is particularly suitable for drift use because it offers better control during transitions, and makes it easier to initiate drifting when braking.In short : under acceleration, 1.5-way and 2-way LSDs react identically. The deceleration lock is much lower on 1.5-way models, making it more suitable for ""grip"". For pure and hard drifting, choose a 2-way model.SuperQ Version ?The SuperQ (Super Quiet) versions of the Kaaz LSDs feature discs that have undergone special treatment, to make the operation smoother and quieter. They provide the same performance as a standard version while reducing the noises sometimes produced at very low speed during manoeuvres. They are therefore recommended for daily road use.Kaaz LSD RatingWhen assembled at the factory in Japan, Kaaz limited-slip differentials are rated for 100% locking, generally optimal for drifting (both wheels spin at exactly the same speed). However, this value can be modified by changing the order of the discs inside the differential housing, to obtain a locking of 35% or 65% according to your needs, more progressive and less radical for road use or grip racing. The diagram below shows you these different possibilities:","Maximum Control !Clutch type limited slip differential (LSD)To suit Toyota GT86 (see applications below)High performances, best reliability Excellent value for money Made in Japan, by Kaaz Bolt on installation Choose your part number in the list below, using the application list",Preorder Only,DriftShop
