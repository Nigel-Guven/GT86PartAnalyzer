        EX-EXH-TIT-5M    





Exhaust heat wrap is one of the easiest and cheapest methods of heat management in your engine bay. There are a few advantages for using exhaust wrap, but the main ones are to decrease engine bay temperatures and to speed up the exhaust gas flow. Exhaust heat wrap is very simple and easy to install, but will have a dramatic effect to your temperatures, and is one of the first go to heat management methods of many racing teams worldwide. The exhaust wrap is simply wrapped around your exhaust manifold and fixed into place using our supplied cable ties to make sure you have a strong tight seal.
The exhaust system of a car carries out the hot exhaust gas from the engine which can reach temperatures of up to 1200 degrees in some extreme applications. The effects of a hot manifold and exhaust system can negatively impact the overall performance of an engine due to intake air temperature. An engine is designed to run at an optimal temperature which will make peak power, usually the cooler the intake temperatures the better an engine will perform and the more power it will make. In some applications the cooling system on a car is not enough to keep the engine at optimal temperatures, resulting in heat soak to engine components which will dramatically reduce the efficiency and power. As well as the efficiency and power being affected by temperature, having too much heat in an engine bay can cause unnecessary wear and strain on delicate components that are not designed to operate in extreme engine bay temperatures. Items such as bearings, fluid lines and wiring can become damaged with overexposure to heat.
Another added benefit of our exhaust heat wrap is that you will reduce any radiating heat from the exhaust through the firewall or chassis resulting in less heat coming into the car. You can reduce temperatures anywhere up to a massive 50% which has a massive number of benefits and virtually no downside.","Product Features:

        EX-EXH-BLA    





Exhaust heat wrap is one of the easiest and cheapest methods of heat management in your engine bay. There are a few advantages for using exhaust wrap, but the main ones are to decrease engine bay temperatures and to speed up the exhaust gas flow. Exhaust heat wrap is very simple and easy to install, but will have a dramatic effect to your temperatures, and is one of the first go to heat management methods of many racing teams worldwide. The exhaust wrap is simply wrapped around your exhaust manifold and fixed into place using our supplied cable ties to make sure you have a strong tight seal.
The exhaust system of a car carries out the hot exhaust gas from the engine which can reach temperatures of up to 1200 degrees in some extreme applications. The effects of a hot manifold and exhaust system can negatively impact the overall performance of an engine due to intake air temperature. An engine is designed to run at an optimal temperature which will make peak power, usually the cooler the intake temperatures the better an engine will perform and the more power it will make. In some applications the cooling system on a car is not enough to keep the engine at optimal temperatures, resulting in heat soak to engine components which will dramatically reduce the efficiency and power. As well as the efficiency and power being affected by temperature, having too much heat in an engine bay can cause unnecessary wear and strain on delicate components that are not designed to operate in extreme engine bay temperatures. Items such as bearings, fluid lines and wiring can become damaged with overexposure to heat.
Another added benefit of our exhaust heat wrap is that you will reduce any radiating heat from the exhaust through the firewall or chassis resulting in less heat coming into the car. You can reduce temperatures anywhere up to a massive 50% which has a massive number of benefits and virtually no downside.","Product Features:

Skunk2's Alpha Series headers are designed using mandrel bends which result in maximum air flow and power. These features, paired with Skunk2s unique design specs, provide an extremely broad powerband thats applicable to a wide range of engine sizes and configurations.

Focussing on manufacturing reliable, affordable and unique products that truly deliver on their promises, AEM is a company that is constantly looking to change the status quo when it comes to automotive electronics. From their boost gauges to their fuel pumps, AEM products are among some of the most sought after electronics, trusted by street enthusiasts and race teams alike.
AEMs legendary Wideband O2 Air/Fuel UEGO Gauge unites unsurpassed accuracy, speed and control with an easy to read, digital interface. This gauge-type controller features a digital LED display and sweeping LED needle that changes colours as AFR changes from rich to lean.
The units 52mm (2-1/16) gauge housing fits in most gauge pods and can be remotely mounted virtually anywhere. All AEM digital gauges feature a 0-5v analogue output for use with data loggers and virtually any engine management system, such as the AEM EMS or FIC. The Bosch 4.9 LSU sensor has a faster light off time and draws less current than the 4.2 LSU sensor used with AEMs 30-4100 Wideband UEGO Controller Gauge.
The 4.9 LSU sensors feature the same fuel compatibility as the 4.2 LSU and NEVER require free-air calibration when used with AEMs 30-4110 Wideband UEGO AFR Gauge. 
AEM's World-famous Wideband O2 Air/Fuel UEGO (Universal Exhaust Gas Oxygen, you-way-go) Gauge is a must for anyone looking to maximize engine power and safety. When tuning an engine, accurate air/fuel ratio data is critical. Running rich can cause a loss in power, while running too lean may result in serious engine damage. The AEM Wideband O2 Air/Fuel UEGO Gauge features large LED numerals that can quickly alert the user to even a .1 change in air/fuel ratio, providing time to shut down an engine before damage occurs.","Features:

        EX-EXH-TIT-15M    





Exhaust heat wrap is one of the easiest and cheapest methods of heat management in your engine bay. There are a few advantages for using exhaust wrap, but the main ones are to decrease engine bay temperatures and to speed up the exhaust gas flow. Exhaust heat wrap is very simple and easy to install, but will have a dramatic effect to your temperatures, and is one of the first go to heat management methods of many racing teams worldwide. The exhaust wrap is simply wrapped around your exhaust manifold and fixed into place using our supplied cable ties to make sure you have a strong tight seal.
The exhaust system of a car carries out the hot exhaust gas from the engine which can reach temperatures of up to 1200 degrees in some extreme applications. The effects of a hot manifold and exhaust system can negatively impact the overall performance of an engine due to intake air temperature. An engine is designed to run at an optimal temperature which will make peak power, usually the cooler the intake temperatures the better an engine will perform and the more power it will make. In some applications the cooling system on a car is not enough to keep the engine at optimal temperatures, resulting in heat soak to engine components which will dramatically reduce the efficiency and power. As well as the efficiency and power being affected by temperature, having too much heat in an engine bay can cause unnecessary wear and strain on delicate components that are not designed to operate in extreme engine bay temperatures. Items such as bearings, fluid lines and wiring can become damaged with overexposure to heat.
Another added benefit of our exhaust heat wrap is that you will reduce any radiating heat from the exhaust through the firewall or chassis resulting in less heat coming into the car. You can reduce temperatures anywhere up to a massive 50% which has a massive number of benefits and virtually no downside.","Product Features:

        BR-G61GSF    





Bride GIASIII Reclining Bucket Seat
The Bride GIASIII Reclining Bucket Seat is a high-quality, racing-inspired seat that is perfect for drivers looking for comfort, style, and safety. Made from durable materials including a steel frame and high-density foam padding, this seat is built to last. The reclining mechanism allows you to adjust the angle of the seat to your liking, while the side-impact protection and 5-point harness provide added safety.
The GIAS series, which has undergone a full model change for the first time in 16 years, is BRIDE's flagship model in reclining sport seats. With ""deep shoulder &amp; high side support"", it is the ultimate super reclining bucket seat that combines high rigidity, sturdiness, hold, and comfort.
Improved Strength










The monocoque shell of the GIASIII model has been improved compared to the previous GIASII model, thanks to a newly designed high-rigidity steel frame based on the STRADIA model. The tensile strength of the frame has increased by 200%, the sturdiness of the backrest has increased by 15%, and the overall sturdiness of the seat has increased by 40%. These improvements have resulted in a more rigid and sturdy seat overall.
Designed for the Track
This model of the seat is equipped with large-sized belt holes in the backrest that are compatible with the FHR system. It also has newly added belt holes on the side of the seat shell that are compatible with a 6-point harness. The size of these belt holes has been reduced compared to the STRADIA model to limit extra movement of the belts and provide a safer experience on the track.
Super Low Thanks to Low Max
The GIAS series features the LOW MAX system, a patented technology by BRIDE that allows for low seat positioning even in limited space. The LOW MAX system also allows for precise adjustment of the steering center and seat center. Please note that this system may not be compatible with all vehicles.",,Preorder Only,TorqueGT

Used around the world in drifting, road racing, rally and all manner of motorsport, KAAZ differentials are some of the finest available. Designed and manufactured in Japan, they react fast and without fail to provide traction to the wheels under acceleration or hard cornering.
With racing or performance driving, your vehicle may demand more then what a factory differential is capable of providing. More traction, stability, quicker reaction times and higher cornering speeds are key factors in which improve your vehicles characteristics on the track. A KAAZ after market Limited Slip Differential designed to cater around these needs will come handy and prove as a vital component on your vehicle.
As well as the standard type diff, KAAZ also offer a SuperQ version. This is mechanically the same as the standard type, however it features WPC coated clutch plates. This will not only drastically reduce the chattering or juddering that the diff will create at low speed, but it also removes the need to break the diff in.","Improved transfer of power

TAROX can trace its history back to the 1970's, designing and crafting bespoke braking solutions, some of which eventually led to Formula 1 race successes throughout the 70's and 80's. In 1983 TAROX released the first commercially available grooved brake disc, the C83. A refined version of this is still available with all TAROX big brake kits in the C88 disc.
TAROX Sport bespoke brake kits are tailor made for each specific application vehicle, tuned to maximise performance of each specific application. Crafted from the finest materials and finished to an incredibly high standard in the TAROX factory in Northern Italy, each kit represents many years of braking know-how and race winning pedigree.
Each caliper is finished in a hard wearing anodised finish, but the Black colour is a particularly hard wearing and recommended for use on a car that will be used on track to avoid discolouration.","Product Features:

Founded in 1997, Australian manufacturer Turbosmart has quickly established itself as a brand that designs and manufactures high quality products which are reasonably priced. Combining innovative design, strict quality control and rigorous testing, Turbosmart are a brand that any forced induction car owner should consider.

Toucan is an innovative touchscreen display unit that connects via CANbus to a wide range of aftermarket ECU's, offering users a wide variety of gauge displays, customisable audio and visual alarms, as well as peak and dynamic markers.






The Toucan has four main gauge pages provided, with each page being totally configurable to show your preffered gauge selection. A quick touch on any of the small gauge causes a full-screen gauge to be displayed.
Alarms can be individually enabled for each parameter, with the alarm thresholds set as required. A low oil temperature warning can be enabled, especially important for turbocharged engines to avoid driving hard when the oils too cold. If an alarm is triggered, the relevant gauge can be configured to automatically display in full-screen.






When used with an AlcaTek, Link, Vi-PEC or MoTeC ecus, launch control and antilag can be turned on and off directly from the touchscreen, and the launch RPM may also be adjusted from the screen for AlcaTek and MoTeC ecus. For Syvecs the launch control status is displayed and ALS can be turned on/off.
Gauges will only be displayed when relevant sensors are wired to the ECU. All avaialble info fed to the ECU can be displayed on a 'list' mode to quickly check values in a non-graphical table.






The display is a full-colour TFT LCD with 320×240 pixels and a resistive touchscreen. Backlight dimming for night time use can be manually selected, and/or automatically enabled if the unit is wired to the vehicles illumination circuit.
Toucan is intended for permanent or semi-permanet installation, and is supplied with your choice of 2 mounts; a magentic vent mount, or an adhesive magnetic mount.","Compatible with a wide range of ECU's, including Link, Syvecs, Vi-PEC, Haltech and MoTeC

        EX-EXH-BLA-5M    





Exhaust heat wrap is one of the easiest and cheapest methods of heat management in your engine bay. There are a few advantages for using exhaust wrap, but the main ones are to decrease engine bay temperatures and to speed up the exhaust gas flow. Exhaust heat wrap is very simple and easy to install, but will have a dramatic effect to your temperatures, and is one of the first go to heat management methods of many racing teams worldwide. The exhaust wrap is simply wrapped around your exhaust manifold and fixed into place using our supplied cable ties to make sure you have a strong tight seal.
The exhaust system of a car carries out the hot exhaust gas from the engine which can reach temperatures of up to 1200 degrees in some extreme applications. The effects of a hot manifold and exhaust system can negatively impact the overall performance of an engine due to intake air temperature. An engine is designed to run at an optimal temperature which will make peak power, usually the cooler the intake temperatures the better an engine will perform and the more power it will make. In some applications the cooling system on a car is not enough to keep the engine at optimal temperatures, resulting in heat soak to engine components which will dramatically reduce the efficiency and power. As well as the efficiency and power being affected by temperature, having too much heat in an engine bay can cause unnecessary wear and strain on delicate components that are not designed to operate in extreme engine bay temperatures. Items such as bearings, fluid lines and wiring can become damaged with overexposure to heat.
Another added benefit of our exhaust heat wrap is that you will reduce any radiating heat from the exhaust through the firewall or chassis resulting in less heat coming into the car. You can reduce temperatures anywhere up to a massive 50% which has a massive number of benefits and virtually no downside.","Product Features:

TAROX can trace its history back to the 1970's, designing and crafting bespoke braking solutions, some of which eventually led to Formula 1 race successes throughout the 70's and 80's. In 1983 TAROX released the first commercially available grooved brake disc, the C83. A refined version of this is still available with all TAROX big brake kits in the C88 disc.
TAROX Sport bespoke brake kits are tailor made for each specific application vehicle, tuned to maximise performance of each specific application. Crafted from the finest materials and finished to an incredibly high standard in the TAROX factory in Northern Italy, each kit represents many years of braking know-how and race winning pedigree.
