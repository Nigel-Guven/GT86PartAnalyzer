Why Ultra Racing use Steel instead of Aluminum?

First, steel is stronger than aluminum for the same size and thickness. In order for aluminum alloys to be at least the same strength as steel, it has to be at least double the thickness (steel 4mm = aluminum 8mm). When that happens, weight saving is not so apparent anymore. Of course there are also exotic materials and alloys that can match the strengths of steel, but the cost are astronomically high and therefore not very cost effective to bring into mass production.

Why Ultra Racing use Steel instead of Aluminum?

First, steel is stronger than aluminum for the same size and thickness. In order for aluminum alloys to be at least the same strength as steel, it has to be at least double the thickness (steel 4mm = aluminum 8mm). When that happens, weight saving is not so apparent anymore. Of course there are also exotic materials and alloys that can match the strengths of steel, but the cost are astronomically high and therefore not very cost effective to bring into mass production.

How does the PedalBox work?



					The PedalBox improves the standard response times of the manufacturer's accelerator pedal. There is an immediate response from the engine with a more sporty feel and no more lag. More fun with the perfect setting for you! The following curves illustrate the speed at which the vehicle reacts to throttle input. Its not about engine power but rather the time it takes for the engine to realise that power! Dynamite does come in small packages. Significant improvements can be felt even in the City (green) mode. The 'Sport' (orange) and 'Sport Plus' (red) modes offer even more of an improvement than the 'City' mode, and all selectable by the driver. The blue line indicates the standard responsiveness of the throttle from the manufacturer and can also be simulated by turning the PedalBox to its OFF mode.

					 

				




Overview: The PedalBox programs



					Using the keypad, four different modes can be selected: City, Sport, Sport+ and Stock. These modes can further be fine-tuned with the Plus and Minus buttons. Over 20 different possible combinations. First, choose your program:

					 

				



CITY (Green): Works well in and around town and on slippery surfaces
SPORT (Orange): This is the default mode and suitable for everyday driving
SPORT-Plus (Red): The quickest possible throttle response, great for the thrill seekers
Stock (White): The car is in stock mode



					 

				


					Once you have selected a program, you can either increase(green/plus) or decrease(red/minus) its intensity.

				





				 

			
Installation made simple



					Installation only takes a few minutes in a few easy steps. The PedalBox comes pre-programmed and requires no complicated setup procedures, the fun starts NOW!

Why Ultra Racing use Steel instead of Aluminum?

First, steel is stronger than aluminum for the same size and thickness. In order for aluminum alloys to be at least the same strength as steel, it has to be at least double the thickness (steel 4mm = aluminum 8mm). When that happens, weight saving is not so apparent anymore. Of course there are also exotic materials and alloys that can match the strengths of steel, but the cost are astronomically high and therefore not very cost effective to bring into mass production.
